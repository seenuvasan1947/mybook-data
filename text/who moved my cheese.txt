"Who Moved My Cheese?" is a motivational book written by Spencer Johnson that uses the parable of two mice and two little people to teach readers how to deal with change. The book has only four chapters and each chapter teaches readers valuable lessons about change, adaptation, and success.

Chapter 1: The Gathering

The first chapter introduces the reader to the four characters in the book, two mice named Sniff and Scurry, and two little people named Hem and Haw. They all live in a maze, which represents their lives. They all have different personalities, and they are all searching for cheese, which represents success and happiness. They all find a large supply of cheese in Cheese Station C and decide to stay there.

Chapter 2: The Story Of Who Moved My Cheese?

In this chapter, the author explains how the characters respond to change. When they find that the cheese in Cheese Station C has run out, Sniff and Scurry quickly move on to find more cheese. In contrast, Hem and Haw are initially shocked and refuse to accept that the cheese is gone. They become angry and frustrated, blaming each other and the world for their problems.

Chapter 3: The Cheese Station C

In this chapter, the author shows the readers how the characters learned to adapt to change. Sniff and Scurry quickly find new cheese stations, while Hem and Haw are still struggling to accept the fact that the cheese has moved. Haw eventually decides to explore the maze and find new cheese stations. Along the way, he learns valuable lessons about taking risks, facing fears, and adapting to change.

Chapter 4: Enjoying The New Cheese

In the final chapter, the author teaches the readers how to make the most of change. Haw eventually finds a new cheese station and learns to enjoy the new cheese. He writes on the wall "When you move beyond your fear, you feel free." He also writes "The quicker you let go of old cheese, the sooner you find new cheese." Hem, on the other hand, remains stuck in his ways, refusing to accept change, and ultimately misses out on finding new cheese and happiness.

Overall, "Who Moved My Cheese?" teaches readers that change is inevitable and that it is important to learn how to adapt to change and embrace new opportunities. The book encourages readers to take risks, face their fears, and embrace change to find success and happiness in life.
